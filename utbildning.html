                            While working as a developer for the 'VR Fire Trainer' app, I took on the responsibility of
                            implementing various features. A significant contribution I made was to revamp their
                            scenario loading system. Initially, JSON was used, but I introduced the use of scriptable
                            objects to enhance the loading process. Additionally, I developed a comprehensive tutorial
                            to guide users in effectively utilizing the application. These valuable improvements and
                            additions are present in their latest app update.
                            Throughout the internship, I deepened my understanding of agile methods and gained
                            proficiency in the effective use of Git as a version control system. This experience has
                            contributed to my ability to work smoothly and collaboratively within development teams.
